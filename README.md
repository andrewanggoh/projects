# Projects

Hello! I'm Andrew, a recent Physics graduate from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) with a strong passion for data science. My academic background has honed my analytical thinking, and I've successfully applied this skillset to data science, where I am passionate about processing and analyzing raw data to extract meaningful insights.

During my college years, I enhanced my technical skills in Python, SQL, and R as a scholarship recipient and an intern at Algoritma Data Science School. I continue to expand my expertise by exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. This page highlights my projects and growth in the field.

I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful data initiatives. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!

## 1. Instagram Account Analysis

  - **RPubs**: [rpubs.com/andrewanggoh/InstagramAccountAnalysis](https://rpubs.com/andrewanggoh/InstagramAccountAnalysis)

- **Description**: In this project, I am trying to analyze the Instagram account of a healthy snack brand by extracting the data using [Apify](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper). Through this project, I perform data cleansing and preparation, starting from adjusting data types, handling missing values and duplicated data, reshaping, and feature engineering. I also perform data analysis to identify which types of posts drive higher engagement and to derive actionable insights that can help boost engagement on the account. My aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the end-to-end workflow of a data analyst

- **Skills**: data cleansing and preparation, data analysis, statistical testing
- **Tools**: Apify, R, RStudio, RPubs

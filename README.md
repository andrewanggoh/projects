# Projects

Hello! I'm Andrew, a recent Physics graduate from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) with a strong passion for data science. My academic background has honed my analytical thinking, and I've successfully applied this skillset to data science, where I am passionate about processing and analyzing raw data to extract meaningful insights.

During my college years, I enhanced my technical skills in Python, SQL, and R as a scholarship recipient and an intern at Algoritma Data Science School. I continue to expand my expertise by exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. This page highlights my projects and growth in the field.

I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful data initiatives. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!

## 1. Telegram Data Report Chatbot

> [!NOTE]
>
> *You can test this Telegram chatbot live [here](https://t.me/DACP_VULCAN_ANDREW_BOT). If the chatbot is unresponsive, it may be due to free-tier hosting limitations. Please check out the demo video ([here](https://youtu.be/H1ibSAcm2_Y)) showcasing its full functionality. Alternatively, you can [contact](#contacts) me and I'll be happy to activate it for you to test live!*

- **Telegram Chatbot**: [DACP_VULCAN_ANDREW_BOT](https://t.me/DACP_VULCAN_ANDREW_BOT)
  
- **Description**: This is my first capstone project that I developed during my studies at Algoritma Data Science School. It is an interactive Telegram chatbot that analyzes Facebook Ads Campaign data and delivers marketing insights. Following the school's structured framework for bot development, I implemented commands (`/start`, `/plot`, etc.) and performed data wrangling, mathematical calculations, and visualization to generate reports and charts. This project honed my data analytics skills, showcasing the ability to deliver insights through an accessible interface.

- **Skills**: data wrangling, data visualization
- **Tools**: Python, Telegram, Telebot, Pythonanywhere

## 2. Instagram Account Engagement Analysis

- **RPubs**: [rpubs.com/andrewanggoh/InstagramAccountEngagementAnalysis](https://rpubs.com/andrewanggoh/InstagramAccountEngagementAnalysis)

- **Description**: AO Snack (pseudonym), a healthy snack brand, uses Instagram to build brand awareness and engage with its audience. I'm taking a role as a data analyst to extract insights and provide recommendations to the social media and marketing teams to drive higher engagement on the Instagram account.

- **Skills**: data cleansing and preparation, data analysis, statistical testing
- **Tools**: Apify, R, RStudio, RPubs

## 3. LLM Application with Retrieval Augmented Generate (RAG)

- **Streamlit**: [aanggoh-llm-rag.streamlit.app](https://aanggoh-llm-rag.streamlit.app)
  
- **Description**: This project explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance LLM accuracy by combining its internal knowledge with external data sources. After performing thorough data preparation and embedding processes, I implemented a FAISS index with cosine similarity for efficient information retrieval. The system was then integrated with an LLM (*Note: I use Gemini 2.0 Flash - Free Version for this project*) to demonstrate RAG's capability to generate more accurate, context-aware responses. I also developed an interactive Streamlit application to showcase this pipeline, allowing users to query against the augmented knowledge base and observe the improvements over standalone LLM responses.

  Here are the things you need to prepare to use the Streamlit app:

  - Prepare a Gemini 2.0 Flash API key
  - Prepare your data in CSV format or use my processed dataset (`games_top200.csv`) included in my [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewanggoh/llm-rag-project)

- **Skills**: data wrangling, feature engineering, streamlit
- **Tools**: Python, Gemini-AI, Streamlit

- **Description**: This is my first capstone project that I developed during my studies at Algoritma Data Science School. It is an interactive Telegram chatbot that analyzes Facebook Ads Campaign data and delivers marketing insights. Following the school's structured framework for bot development, I implemented commands (`/start`, `/plot`, etc.) and performed data wrangling, mathematical calculations, and visualization to generate reports and charts. This project honed my data analytics skills, showcasing the ability to deliver insights through an accessible interface.

- **Skills**: data wrangling, data visualization
- **Tools**: Python, Telegram, Telebot, Pythonanywhere
